# Hello-World

For this Assignment you are going to create a script that prints "Hello world" to the Powershell window. It is recommended that you watch all the lecture in the Module 7 section to complete this assignment. 

In your Windows VM:

In your documents folder create a folder called "Scripts"
Create a plain text file called Helloworld.txt
In the plain text file write your code to print the string "Hello world"
Save the file and rename the file extension from .txt to .ps1
Start Powershell and run the cmdlet [Start-transcript]
Navigate to the Script folder in powershell
Select and run your Helloworld.ps1 script
You should see Hello world was printed to the Powershell Window
Run the cmdlet [Stop-transcript]
Go to file location where the .txt is stored
Rename the file to "FirstName-LastName-Assignment7a.txt"
Upload both your helloworld.ps1 script and the transcription file to this Assignment section before the Deadline
I have linked to Microsoft documentation on how Start-Transcript and Stop-Transcript work below:

Start-Transcript
Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/start-transcript?view=powershell-7 (Links to an external site.)

Stop-Transcript
Link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/stop-transcript?view=powershell-7 (Links to an external site.)

Note: Unless you specify where the file is stored, [Start-Transcript] stores the transcripts in the $Home\My Documents directory as \PowerShell_transcript.<time-stamp>.txt files.
